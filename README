Paleomapper, a project started way back when, is a simple Xt
app to display rotation file data and continent soundings
from magnetometers at mid-ocean ridges.

For more information, please contact David Rowley at the 
Geophysical Sciences Department of the University of Chicago.

To build, just do a `make`. Nothin' fancy, though you do need
to install the headers for motif/lesstif, Xlib, and alsa-oss
(if you want midi support).
