PMAG - Paleomagnetic Data
   When this toggle button is selected, paleomapper will display existing PMAG data within 10 my of the current paleotime and a Fisher Mean Pole according to the display and data options selected.  
   When GetInfo is the picking option, clicking on PMAG data with the middle button will recall information associated with that particular PMAG data.  This information includes: PMAG data ID number, ID of plate where data is located, youngest age associated with data, oldest age associated with data, latitude of unrotated (not in reconstructed coordinates) data location, longitude of unrotated data location, and the uncertainty in the location.  
   On the paleomapper display, the reconstructed location of the data is marked by an X, and the  magnitude of the uncertainty (radius in degrees) is identified by the circle enclosing the X. 
   When GetInfo is the picking option, clicking on PMAG Pole with the middle button will recall information associated with the Fisher Mean Pole of plotted PMAG data.  This information includes: latitude and longitude of Fisher Mean Pole from reconstructed PMAG data locations, kappa and alpha of Fisher Mean Pole Uncertainty, number of plates with PMAG data that contributed to determining the pole, and the number of data points used in determining the pole.   
   On the paleomapper display, the Fisher Mean Pole location is marked by a magenta X with arbitrarly constant size.  The location is determined from reconstructed PMAG data locations also shown on the display.
   PMAG data can be loaded into paleomapper with the Get PMAG Data command found in the Main Menu (or by typing 'P'). 

P W - Apparent Polar Wander Path
   When this toggle button is selected, paleomapper will display a apparent polar wander path.  The first time this button is selected, paleomapper will ask you for some information about the apparent polar wander path.  These include: rotation file, starting paleotime, ending paleotime, paleotime increment, and the fixed plate for rotations.  If you wish to reset this information at any time, just select the Reset PW Variables button at the bottom of the PMAG Options Box.  The apparent polar wander path will be constructed by determining the Fisher Mean Pole of existing PMAG data within 10 My of each paleotime bewteen the start and end paleotime.  Points on the path will be determined for each paleotime increment.  Existing PMAG data within 10 my of the current paleotime will also be shown according to the display and data options selected.

   Selecting this checkbox will remove the PMAG data from the paleomapper display.  Unselecting the checkbox will redisplay the PMAG data.

Hide Pole - Do not display Fisher Mean Pole
   Selecting this checkbox will remove the Fisher Mean Pole of PMAG data from the paleomapper display.  Unselecting the checkbox will redisplay the pole.
