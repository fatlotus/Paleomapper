		#Choose Image
  This will load the Snapshot image capture program.  Here's the best way to use it.
  First click on the Choose Image command, and put your snapshot window somewhere besides where you want to take pictures.  (ie, not inside the paleomap window).  Then put your mouse pointer over the Snapshot window and drag the left button to create a box about the size of the image you want to create.  Release the left mouse button, and then position you pointer on the Snapshot window.  Press and hold the Shift key.  (this will allow you to modify your box, so keep holding it until we're completely done setting up this box!)  Now move to the center of your box so your pointer changes from an arrow to a four-pronged arrow/cross thing.  Pressing the left-mouse button (still holding the shift key) drag you box over to where the paleomap window is.  Release the left mouse button to drop it there.  Then position the mouse in one of the four corners so you can manipulate the size of the box.  Again, while still holding the shift key, drag the corner of the box with the left mouse button.  Repeat this until the box is the correct size.  Finally, release the shift key (whew!).

  You can now save images by positioning your mouse inside the little Snapshot window and pressing the right mouse button.  This will bring up a menu of choices.  First, select New File Name.  Type in the name of the file you want to make.  Then select Save As (Your Name) to take a picture of the image inside you red box and save it as an RGB file.

		#Convert Image
  This is new.  It will convert a given RGB-format image into a given TIFF-format image.  You will be prompted for the input and output names.
