		#Get Data
  Command used to load a specific form of data. This is how most data is loaded into the
program.  A File Selection popmenu is loaded, allowing the user to choose which datafile is
desired.  The current directory for this file selection tool is the data/.  Although other
directories can be searched, this directory should have plenty of data for use with 
paleomapper.  A file can be loaded by double clicking on it, or by clicking on the file once, 
and then clicking the OK button.  Once the file is loaded a message box will appear informing 
you of how many vectors the program processed, which is a measure of how many points were 
loaded from the datafiles.
